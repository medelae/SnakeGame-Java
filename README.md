A pretty simple game of snake I put together back in university! Made with Java's GUI.

- Basic Rules: The object of the game is to eat as many apples as possible for a high score. The snake grows in length with each apple it consumes. Its speed also gradually increases. The game ends if the snake collides with itself or the game border.
- Controls: Move the snake with the traditional arrow keys ⬆⬇⬅➡

Feel free to use the apple pixel for anything. I release it to the public domain.
