# SnakeGame-JavaGUI
A simple game of snake I put together back in university. Made with Java's GUI.

*Controls and Features*
- Basic Rules: The object of the game is to eat as many apples as possible for a high score. The snake grows in length and moves faster each time it eats an apple. If the snake collides with itself or the game border, it's Game Over.
- Controls: Move the snake with the traditional arrow keys ⬆⬇⬅➡

Feel free to use the apple pixel for anything. I release it to the public domain.
